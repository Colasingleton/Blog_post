        <p>I know it might seem like there are so many avenues to take,
            but you’ll be better disciplined if you can pick a path or a 
            language, and build from there.</p> 

        <p>None of it is easy and all of it requires hard work and persistence. 
            Just keep going for it and one day it will stick. </p> 
        
        <p>In my experience, I decided to go down one path and found it too difficult, 
            so I veered off into another and quickly realized that I won’t find an easy way in.
            Good! Hard work is the only way you will get good at this. Consistent work will make sure you stay good. 
            Pick a thing, set some goals, and give yourself a chance to become amazing.</p>
