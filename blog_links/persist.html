        <p>Keep going! Some people learn faster than others and some people have better connections to an industry than others. 
            It’s important to not compare and keep doing what makes sense for you.</p> 

        <p> Keep coding, keep networking, keep learning and eventually you’ll land exactly where you want to be.</p> 

        <p>Persistence is key to your success, and you’ll soon find out that most people are like you. 
            Everyone starts somewhere, so don’t be embarrassed to keep pushing through. 
            Even if it looks like you aren’t making progress,
            You are!</p> 

        <p>Lastly. You are who you say you are, 
            believe great things about yourself. </p> 

        <p>You too, are a Software Engineer!</p>
