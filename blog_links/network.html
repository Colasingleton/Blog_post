        <p>I didn’t spend all of my time going out to events and finding friends that could do things for me. 
            Your network can be a combination of friends that have friends, 
            folks you meet at the gym, work, or even the internet!</p>
        <p>Connect with people and find out what they know. 
            There are many online communities for your niche interests as well. Join slack groups and exchange referrals.</p> 

        <p> Many in my network are co-workers and friends. People I’ve met with similar interests. 
            It happens in a magnetic way and then boom! Your network is expanding. 
            Keep making friends!</p>
