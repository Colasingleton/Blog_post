        <p>One youâ€™ve picked a path, research free programs. 
            There are many free resources to learn coding and applications. 
            Find scholarships, college courses, and whatever else the vast web can provide. 
            Then look up paid courses. </p> 

        <p>Paid courses can range in price, 
            but they also range in instruction styles. 
            Find a course with instructors,
            or something more self-paced if you prefer.
            You can do both and discover what works for you. 
            I found that with a combination of instruction and hands on learning, 
            I churn out my best work.</p>

            <p>Making projects and getting feedback works best for me. 
            Most importantly, research is about sourcing materials that are manageable for <em>your</em> individual needs.</p>
