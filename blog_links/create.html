        <p>Practice by building projects. 
            Consistently create new things and perfect the old ones. 
            Try out new concepts and give yourself a challenging goal.</p> 

        <p> You can add all of those projects to a portfolio that will count as experience.
            The more the better.<p> 

        <p>I like to recreate things I see as a template, 
            and then add my personal stylings to them. 
            Being able to duplicate a design is just as important as creating new ones. </p>
